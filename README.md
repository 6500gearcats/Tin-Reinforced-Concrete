# Tin-Reinforced-Concrete
Team 6500's evergreen library, currently in development

## What's this?
We're in the process of creating a library our team can use multiple times throughout the years to make the task of the programmers much easier

## Can I help?
Maybe! If you can read our robot code from last year, you can help us translate it into a more general form, that way it can be used here

## What's the name all about?
It's what appears to be a bad idea at first, but turns out to be an ok one if you think about it. Concrete is reinforced due to it's low strength on one axis, commonly done with steel because it is both flexible and resilient.  Similarly, tin is a somewhat flexible metal so it may work to a certain extent but it does not have the resilience of concrete so it may not work super well. This is an analogy for the possiblity of the usefulness of this library.
